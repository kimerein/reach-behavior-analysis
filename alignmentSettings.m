% Maxlag for initial alignment
% May help constrain alignment for better results

% The following values help the alignment by giving an estimate of when
% the movie fits into the arduino data.
% If isInSecondHalf is false, the code will start looking for an appropriate
% alignment of the movie data at the beginning of the arduino data.
% If, in fact, the movie comes in the second half of the arduino data
% stream, indicate this by setting isInSecondHalf to true.
settings.isInSecondHalf=false; % set this to true if movie matches a later section of arduino data stream

% For fractionThroughArduino ...
% Where in the arduino data stream does the movie begin? 
% If isInSecondHalf is 1, we will discard the first nth of the arduino data
% stream before looking for an alignment with the movie, where n is
% fractionThroughArduino.
% This helps code find the correct alignment.
% For example, if the movie begins 75% of the way through the arduino data
% stream, set fractionThroughArduino to 3/4.
settings.fractionThroughArduino=0.6; 

% The code will try different scalings of the movie data onto the arduino
% data. An initial guess at the correct scaling will be chosen based on a
% preliminary alignment. The code will then try to further refine this
% estimate (called guess_best_scale) by trying different scalings similar 
% to this best guess. The code will try all scalings between
% tryscales=guess_best_scale+try_scale1:tryinc:guess_best_scale+try_scale2

% If the preliminary alignment seems to produce an under-scaling of movie
% data with respect to arduino data, increase try_scale1 and try_scale2.
% If the preliminary alignment seems to produce an over-scaling of movie
% data with respect to arduino data, decrease try_scale1 and try_scale2.

% Similarly, the code will try different delays of the movie data with
% respect to the arduino data. An initial guess at the correct delay is
% chosen based on a preliminary alignment. The code will then try to
% further refine this estimate (called guess_best_delay) by trying
% different delays similar to this best guess. The code will try all delays
